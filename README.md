# jsrproject1 - Chatbot!

##Project 1 for Javascript Class through General Assembly

* JSR Project 1 to create a chatbot based on the HAL9000.  
* I have also incorporated answers that reflect combining the Dave's not here skit from Cheech and Chong 
* This was inspired by the following video.

## What Hal responds to

* Any question with the words 'door', 'jar', 'open', 'I've got the stuff' and 
* your own name as you typed it in initially will return a response.  
* It may not be the most helpful response, but, like the Beastie Boys said, never trust a HAL9000.

## Unsolved

* I did not see a good use for RegEx that would not have involved trying to create a new problem 
* that was outside of the scope of the project.
* I was interested in using a Switch Case statement, but the looping logic seemed like a more efficient approach.
