# Chatbot!

## Our favorite AI nemesis, HAL9000 vs. Dave Bowman

* Construct a chatbot that responds to various inputs from Dave
* Feel free to use the HTML and CSS scaffolds or construct your own
* Be creative with your logic and responses!
* Feel free to also change the characters and anything in the starter codeâ€”be creative!

## Grading Rubric (Pass/Partial/Fail)

### Required

* Have the AI respond to user input
* Do at least 3 different things
* One of the commands must utilize the list of people in the class to send a reply
* Use at least 1 conditional to change the response
* Leverage a for loop to iterate over a collection
* Use a random component
* Go above and beyond simple `if/else` statements

### Stretch Goals

* Have 2 or more AIs responding based upon user input
* Use a regular expression to parse and manipulate the response
* Have a conversation between two AIs (without creating an infinite loop!)

## Deliverables

* A working chatbot hosted somewhere publicly accessible (CodePen, Github Pages, etc.)
* A new git respository containing your code
* A `README.md` file with explanations of what your bot does, what commands it responds to, the approach taken, unsolved problems, etc.
